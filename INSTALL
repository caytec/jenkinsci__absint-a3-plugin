The AbsInt aÂ³ Jenkins Plugin will be part of the continuous integration build process on DEV@cloud.
You will be able to directly access and install the plugin from your Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins site.


If you want to manually build the plugin you can use the following Maven command in the "pom.xml" project directory:
"mvn package"

A "target" directory including the "a3.hpi" binary version of the plugin will be generated.
